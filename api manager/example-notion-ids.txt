Publically storing notion IDs isn't an issue as long as your API keys are securely stored 
(like system env var) but just to be a little bit more careful with this public repo I'm going
to add a separate .notion-ids file to untrack with .gitignore.

To do the same, create inside your root folder a ".notion-ids" file to easily add/edit ID variables
[.notion-ids]
{
	"{your-page-var-name}": "{your-notion-page-id}",
	"{your-database-var-name}": "{your-notion-database-id}"
}

[example]
{
 	"EXPLORATION_LOG_PAGE_ID": "4qba22955v910h30e118u56irgfjy7ku",
 	"EXPLORATION_PATHS_DATABASE_ID": "xe311qiwa70987yh0s47ea4qh6zf5rf0"
}
